# HTML5practice

## This is a simple **HTML5** exercise

Using **HTML5** as a foundation on how to build content on a Web Browser. As of now, I will only be using header tags to get the true hang of how **HTML5** works.

However, more features will be included on this simple **HTML5** index file.

However, please feel free to make any comments, if my descriptions are completely off, or if I can explain certain factors more in detail.

Thank you,
